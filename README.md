# Minnal_Kart

This is the github repository for mini project of my MCA(2020-2021) course under KTU. The aim of the project is create a racing game titled **Minnal_Kart** with the help of Unity.

### Introduction:

In order to create great games, one needs to be well versed in the games that are currently being played and have
been successful in the past. This means that one should also play games that you normally would not play and even
games that one doesn't like. Not all people like all games. There are many different types of games from entertainment
games to educational games, games for health, games for science and many more. Being able to critically look at games
and identify which elements work well, which elements could be improved and which elements I might use for my own
games will help me become a great game designer.
Breaking into the games industry is possible with a “little bit” of work. It can also be hugely rewarding. As it is
now its impossible to think about a world without computers. If not by a long shot I would like to create a top grossing
game at some point in my career or at least be part of create one. I hope my mini project to be my stepping stone onto
the wide ocean of possibilities in game development and hope to strike gold someday. I am sure that I will thoroughly
enjoy myself while doing so..
We will be focussing on creating a racing game. Racing games are a video game genre in which the player
participates in a racing competition. They may be based on anything from real-world racing leagues to fantastical
settings. They are distributed along a spectrum between more realistic racing simulations and more fantastical arcadestyle racing games. Kart racing games emerged in the 1990s as a popular sub-genre of the latter. Racing games may also
fall under the category of sports video games.
environments.

### Objectives:

Since game development is time consuming and laborious, the primary objective of the project is the time
bound release of a playable version of the game with limited functionalities which is supposed to be enhanced or
updated in the main project.

### Problem Definition:

Understanding Unity will be the key for the progress of this project. Initially, the templates provided by unity
will thoroughly gone through and fiddled with. If possible will be incorporated in to the said project.
There will be multiple game modes available for the player, like time attack, circuit, free roam. There will be
multiple difficulty levels. The game will be played against computer controlled vehicles or players. The user will be able
to select his or her character, choose a particular vehicle each of which will have its own attributes and special abilities.
The player will be able to customize their looks and also their vehicle's appearance as well. If possible we will also try to
incorporate a currency system into the game which will allow the player to unlock more content and functionalities. We
will also try to add an in-app purchasing system for game currency.

### Basic Functionalities:

There will be an intuitive UI. The depth and count of the following features would be determined by the time
constraint.
  * Maps
     * The whole map is navigable for the player. The race track are customizable. The player can decide the
number of laps the length. 
  * Cars
      * There will be atleast 2(maximum 4) cars which can be selected from the menu.
  * Specials
      * The track will be scattered with special abilites and power up which can be activated by driving over them. The special abilities will only available to the players after 30 seconds of gameplay 
  * Music or SFX
  * GFX
  * Sprites
  * Game Modes
 
 ### Tools / Platform, Hardware and Software Requirements:
   
   * Unity and Unity Hub essential for the progress of this project
   * Photoshop is be used to modify sprites
   * Blender asset may or may not be used depending on ease of access and taking into consideration whether it is
possible to incorporate them in to the app.
  *  Some sound mixers and open source sprites, music, sfx will be used.
  *  Any modern smart phone would suffice
  *  Minimum Specs: 4 GB RAM, intel i3 processor, intel HD
  *  Recommended: 8 GB RAM, intel i5 processor, intel UHD or higher
